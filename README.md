### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed in the labs helped prepare me to complete the assignment. I felt unprepared to complete the viewing movies feature because I was not able to do it on the lab.
* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would change the Clear Search button to be the popcorn icon in the Flixster title. I would have also added in the popup feature.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

During the project demo I was able to show all the features I implemented, but my presentation was really short compared to everyone else's therefore in the future I will try to set aside a minute or two to go over what I want to say during the project demo. A couple of my peers showed their code after demoing their project to explain how they completed the features, therefore I will try to do that too in the future.

### Open-source libraries used
I did not use any open source libraries but I used W3Schools whenever I needed help implementing javascript or css features.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
Thank you to Camila for helping me render movie posters on my website and the TA's for answering all of my questions!
